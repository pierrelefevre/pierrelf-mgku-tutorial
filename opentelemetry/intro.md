# Tracing and Profiling Applications with OpenTelemetry

In this tutorial, you will learn how to instrument a web application with OpenTelemetry to enable tracing and profiling. We will cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction to OpenTelemetry**: Understand the basics of OpenTelemetry, its components, and the concept of distributed tracing.
2. **Setting up the Environment**: Prepare your development environment by installing the necessary tools and packages.
3. **Creating a Sample Web Application**: Build a simple web application using Python and Flask.
4. **Instrumenting the Application**: Learn how to instrument your web application with OpenTelemetry, including setting up tracing and configuring the Jaeger exporter.
5. **Generating and Analyzing Trace Data**: Generate traces by interacting with your web application, and analyze the trace data using Jaeger.
6. **Best Practices for Tracing and Profiling Applications**: Learn best practices for implementing tracing and profiling in your applications.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of OpenTelemetry and be able to apply tracing and profiling techniques to your applications. This knowledge will help you monitor and optimize your application's performance, identify bottlenecks, and improve the overall user experience.
