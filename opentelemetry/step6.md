Access the application at [application]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_5000}}) and generate some traces.

Open the [Jaeger UI]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_16686}}) to visualize the traces.

You now have a simple web application instrumented with OpenTelemetry for tracing. This example uses the Jaeger exporter, but you can switch to other exporters like Zipkin or OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) by changing the exporter configuration in the trace.py file. Remember to adjust the exporter environment variables and Docker commands accordingly.
