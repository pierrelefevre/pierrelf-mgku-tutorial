After generating some traces by accessing the application, you can analyze and visualize them using the Jaeger dashboard.

In the "Service" dropdown menu, select "my-service" (or the name you assigned to the service.name attribute in the trace.py file).
Click the "Find Traces" button to search for traces related to the selected service.
You'll see a list of traces with their corresponding start times, trace IDs, and duration. Click on any trace to see more details.
In the trace details view, you'll find the following information:

A visual representation of the trace, displaying the spans and their relationships in a timeline.
The total number of spans in the trace.
A list of all spans, showing their operation names, start times, and duration. Click on a span to view more information, such as span tags and logs.


Use the Jaeger dashboard to:

- Identify slow or problematic requests by examining span durations and comparing them to the expected behavior.
- Visualize the relationships between spans to understand the flow of requests through your application.
- Investigate specific spans to gain insights into your application's performance and potential bottlenecks.
- You can also use Jaeger's advanced search features, such as searching by tags or selecting a specific time range, to filter and analyze traces more effectively. Spend some time exploring the dashboard and familiarizing yourself with its various features to get the most value from your tracing data.
